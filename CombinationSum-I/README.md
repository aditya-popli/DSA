# Combination Sum Solution

This is a solution to the problem of finding all unique combinations in a given list of candidates where the sum of the combinations is equal to a given target. The solution leverages backtracking to explore all possible combinations of candidates that sum up to the target.

## Problem Statement

Given a list of candidate numbers `candidates` and a target number `target`, find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the sum of the combinations equals the target.

### Constraints:
- Each number in `candidates` can be used multiple times in the combination.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.
