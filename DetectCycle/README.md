# ðŸš€ Detect Cycle in a Linked List

This project implements cycle detection in a singly linked list using **Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm** (also known as the Tortoise and Hare approach).

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a linked list, determine if it contains a cycle. A cycle occurs when a nodeâ€™s `next` pointer points back to a previous node, forming a loop.

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

We use two pointers:
- **Slow Pointer** moves one step at a time.
- **Fast Pointer** moves two steps at a time.

If there's a cycle, the fast and slow pointers will eventually meet.
