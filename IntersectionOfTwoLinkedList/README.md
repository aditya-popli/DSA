# 🔗 Intersection of Two Linked Lists

This repository contains the solution to finding the **intersection node** of two singly linked lists using **C++**.

---

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the heads of two singly linked lists `headA` and `headB`, return the node at which the two lists intersect.  
If the two linked lists have no intersection, return `NULL`.

---

## 📂 Example

### Input:

List A: `4 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5`  
List B: `5 -> 6 -> 1 -> 8 -> 4 -> 5`

(Intersection starts at node with value `8`.)

### Output:

```bash
Intersected at '8'
