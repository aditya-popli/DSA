# Count Inversions in Array

This repository contains a solution to the problem of counting the total number of inversions in an integer array of size `N`. An inversion is defined as a pair of integers `(ARR[i], ARR[j])` such that:

1. `ARR[i] > ARR[j]`
2. `i < j`

## Problem Description

Given an array/list of integers `ARR` of size `N` where all values are distinct, you are tasked with counting the total number of inversions in the array.
