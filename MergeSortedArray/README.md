# Merge Sorted Arrays Solution

This repository contains a C++ solution for merging two sorted arrays into one sorted array. The solution modifies the first array in-place, making it a space-efficient approach.

## Problem Description

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` has enough space to accommodate the elements of `nums2`, the task is to merge the elements of `nums2` into `nums1` such that `nums1` becomes a sorted array.
