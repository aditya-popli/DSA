## ðŸ§¾ Problem Description

Design a **stack** that supports the following operations **in constant time O(1)**:

- `push(val)`: Push the element `val` onto the stack.
- `pop()`: Removes the element on the top of the stack.
- `top()`: Gets the top element.
- `getMin()`: Retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution where **all operations have O(1) time complexity**.
