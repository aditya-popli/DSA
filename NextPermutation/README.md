# Next Permutation Solution

This C++ solution implements the **Next Permutation** algorithm. The goal is to rearrange a sequence of numbers into its next lexicographically greater permutation.

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers, the task is to rearrange the numbers into the next permutation in **lexicographical order**. If such a permutation doesn't exist (i.e., the array is sorted in descending order), rearrange it into the smallest possible order (i.e., ascending order).
