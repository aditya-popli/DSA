# Find Nth Root of an Integer

## Problem Statement
You are given two positive integers `n` and `m`.  
Your task is to return the `n`-th root of `m`, i.e., `m^(1/n)`.

- If the `n`-th root is an **integer**, return it.
- Otherwise, return **-1**.

**Definition**:  
The `n`-th root of an integer `m` is a number that when raised to the power `n` gives `m`.
