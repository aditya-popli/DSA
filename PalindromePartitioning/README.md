# Palindrome Partitioning Solution

This repository contains a solution for the problem of partitioning a string into all possible palindrome substrings. The goal is to find all possible ways to partition a string such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome.

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.
