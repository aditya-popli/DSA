## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an `n x n` matrix where:
- `1` represents a free path.
- `0` represents a blocked cell.

A rat starts from the cell `(0, 0)` and aims to reach `(n-1, n-1)`.  
It can move in **four directions**:
- `D` (Down)
- `L` (Left)
- `R` (Right)
- `U` (Up)

Find **all possible paths** the rat can take to reach the destination without revisiting any cell in the same path.

**Note:**  
- Return paths in **lexicographical order**.
- If no path exists, return an empty list.
