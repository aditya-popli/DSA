# Rotate Matrix Solution

This repository contains a solution to rotate an NxN matrix by 90 degrees in place. The algorithm performs the rotation in two main steps: first, it reverses the rows, then it transposes the matrix.

## Problem Description

Given an NxN matrix, the task is to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place.
