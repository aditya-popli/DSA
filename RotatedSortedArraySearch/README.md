# 🔍 Rotated Sorted Array Search (C++)

This project implements an efficient solution to search for a target value in a **rotated sorted array** using a combination of **pivot finding** and **binary search**.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Given a rotated sorted array `nums` and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not.

The array was originally sorted in ascending order and then rotated at an unknown pivot.
