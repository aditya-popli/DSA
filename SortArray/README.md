# Sort Colors Solution

This repository contains a solution to the "Sort Colors" problem, a common problem in coding interviews.

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, represented by integers `0`, `1`, and `2` respectively, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent. The solution should use constant space.

- `0` represents red,
- `1` represents white,
- `2` represents blue.
