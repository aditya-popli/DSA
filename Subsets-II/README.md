# Subsets with Duplicates

This repository contains a solution to the problem of generating all possible subsets of a given array, where the array can contain duplicate elements. The solution uses **backtracking** and ensures that the subsets generated are unique, even when the input array contains duplicates.

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution must ensure that no duplicate subsets are included in the final result.
