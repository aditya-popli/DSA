# ðŸ”¢ Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix

This repository contains a C++ implementation to find the **k-th smallest element** in a sorted matrix.  
The matrix is sorted in ascending order both **row-wise** and **column-wise**.

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

Given an `n x n` matrix of integers where each row and each column is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `k`, return the `k`-th smallest element in the matrix.

### Example

```cpp
Input: 
matrix = [
  [1, 5, 9],
  [10, 11, 13],
  [12, 13, 15]
]
k = 8

Output: 13
